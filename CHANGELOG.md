## 0.1.2+8

### Saturday, 28th November, 2020

* __Breaking Change:__ The DotShape property __`line`__ renamed to __`dash`__.

* `goNext`, `goPrevious`, and `Foo.externallyControlled` properties and constructors deprecated and __will be removed in version 0.1.3__ from Icon, Image, Number, and Dot Steppers. Instead, introduced the `activeStep` property, a __simpler__ approach to control the steppers either from built-in buttons, by tapping, or from external buttons. @github issues: [#5](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/5), [#9](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/9).

* The `activeStep` can also be used to either set the initial step or jump to any step. @github issues: [#7](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/7)

* Deprecated the `dotReachedIndex` property in the DotStepper. This function is now redundant as the same can be tracked using the `activeStep` property.

* Two new function properties introduced in DotStepper; `lowerBound` and `upperBound`. These maybe required in conditionals to control stepping forward and backward using the `activeStep`.

* __BugFix:__ Previous button icon not working @github issue: [#8](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/8)

* Updated the documentation.

* Many thanks to: [elliot](https://github.com/zelliot), [MastPollo10](https://github.com/Mastpollo10), [atul-khemka](https://github.com/atul-khemka), and [thfr69](https://github.com/thfr69)

## 0.1.2+6

### Thursday, 15th October, 2020

## 0.1.2+5

### Sunday, 20th September, 2020

* IconStepper, ImageStepper, and NumberStepper can now be controlled from external buttons, by using the relevant constructor marked as `FooStepper.externallyControlled`. @ github issues [#3](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/3) and [#4](https://github.com/imujtaba8488/package_im_stepper/issues/4)
