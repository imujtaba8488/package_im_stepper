## Recent Changes

Here's a list of some important changes in version: __0.1.2+9__. For a complete list of changes see changelog [here](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/changelog).

* __NEW FUNCTIONALITY AND BREAKING CHANGES:__

  * `DotStepper` has been completely revamped to support controlling the stepper in multiple ways. New features such as line-connectors, spacing between dots, modern indicator effects, new dot shapes, etc. have been added. However, certain __breaking changes__ happened along the way. 

  * `activeStep` now starts from 0 and NOT from 1. Maximum `activeStep` is therefore now `dotCount` minus 1.
  
  * `lowerBound` and `upperBound` have been removed.

  * Please update your code! See examples __[here](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example)__.

* Introducing the `activeStep` property, a __simpler__ way to control the steppers either from built-in buttons, by tapping, or from external buttons with the ability to set initial step or jump to any step.

* __Future Breaking Changes__: `goNext`, `goPrevious`, and `Foo.externallyControlled` properties and constructors have been _deprecated_ and will be removed from Icon, Image, Number, and Dot Steppers in version __0.1.3__.

## About

A growing collection of stepper and page indicator widgets.

## Description

The stepper widgets help you to show or collect information from users using organized steps. The page indicator widgets allow you to visually notify users about their current position as they scroll through a group of pages.

## General Guidelines

* Simply import `package:im_stepper/stepper.dart`.

* __Important:__ The `direction` argument controls whether the stepper is displayed horizontally or vertically. A horizontal IconStepper can be wrapped within a Column with no issues. However, if wrapped within a row, it _must also be_ wrapped within the built-in _Expanded_ widget. The same applies to the vertical IconStepper.

* __Validation:__ To enable validation before the next step is reached, set the `steppingEnabled` property to an appropriate value in a `StatefulWidget`.

* __Controlling Steppers:__ All steppers are controlled using the `activeStep` property. You can control a stepper by:-

  * using the built-in next and previous buttons.

  * tapping individual steps in case of Icon, Image, and Number steppers. Please note that the tapping behavior doesn't apply to the `DotStepper`.

  * using external buttons or events.

    * See examples __[here](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example)__.

* To customize the color, border, etc., wrap a stepper widget inside a `Container` and specify it's `decoration` argument.

## IconStepper

Simple to use icon stepper widget, wherein each icon defines a step. Hence, the total number of icons represents the total number of available steps. [See Example](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example).

## ImageStepper

Simple to use image stepper widget, wherein each image defines a step. Hence, the total number of images defines the total number of steps. [See Example](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example).

## NumberStepper

A simple to use number stepper widget, wherein each number defines a step. Hence, the total count of numbers defines the total number of steps. [See Example](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example).

## DotStepper

A family of fully customizable, beautiful page indicator widgets with awesome built-in animations. Each dot in a DotStepper represents a step. [See Example](https://pub.dev/packages/im_stepper/example).
